## My Process

### Built With
- **Semantic HTML5** for structure
- **CSS custom properties** for styling
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first workflow** for responsiveness

### What I Learned
This challenge helped me practice responsive design principles and improved my skills with CSS flexbox. Below is an example of code I was proud of:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```
### Continued Development
In the future, I want to:

- Explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid.
- Improve the accessibility of my projects.
- Experiment with adding animations for better user experience.

### Useful Resources
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Flexbox Guide - Helped me refine my understanding of flexbox layout.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A Guide to Flexbox - A great resource for mastering flexbox properties.
